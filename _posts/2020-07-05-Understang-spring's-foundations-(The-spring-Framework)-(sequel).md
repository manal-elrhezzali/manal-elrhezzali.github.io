## **Introduction**

Greetings!
 Today we're going to talk about the remaining **three out of six**key areas of the spring framework.
 As we already said in the last blog ,the spring Framework is a universal,
 reusable software environment that provides particular functionality(like web development and data access)
 as a part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications,solutions and products.
 The spring framework was the beginning of Spring .
 It was created to simply the development process and it became the foundation for which all spring projects were built upon.
 Applications could then in turn utilize these projects along with the spring framework,
 to even further simplify their development. 
 
 
## **Three out of six key areas of the spring framework**

The spring framework utilizes a **modular architecture** meaning that it‚Äôs broken up into separate individual 
components that can be connected together and each of those components is then responsible 
for providing a set of functionality and together as a whole they make up the spring framework .

#### 1. **Spring Data Access**

* The Spring Framework‚Äôs Data Access module makes it easier to develop 
applications that interact with data and it removes a ton of **boilerplate 
code** ( refers to sections of code that have to be included in many places 
with little or no alteration.)

 ![dataAccess example ]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/dataAccessExample.png" | relative_url }})

* **Database transactions** with the spring framework‚Äôs Data Access module are really easy.
**A database transaction** is a series of database operations that must happen together (that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they all happen at once ) or not at all.

  For example: 

  ![dataTransaction example 1]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/exapleTransaction.png" | relative_url }})
  Transferring money between two bank accounts ,
  you first have to subtract the  amount  from the first 
  account and then you add that amount to the second account.
  And if the subtraction of the money succeeds, but the addition fails,
  then the money‚Äôs lost. And likewise,if the subtraction fails ,
  but the addition succeeds,then somebody just got that amount for free.
  So as you can see transferring money between two bank account must be 
  transactional. It must happen all together or not at all.

* Another small ,but useful feature provided by the Data Access module is **Exception Translation**( Exceptions are an event within a program that disrupt execution).
  The problem this feature solves is that different database vendors use different errors and exceptions for the same class of errors.

  For example:
   
   ![Exception translation]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/exceptionTranslation.png" | relative_url }})
  The Data Access module of the Spring Framework helps by taking these database-specific error codes and translating them into a well-known set of exceptions.
   
   ![Exception translation]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/exceptionTrans2.png" | relative_url }})
  
* **Testing data** is easier with the spring framework‚Äôs Data Access Module.Since Spring framework is managing the configuration and the set up of how an application accesses its
  data, it‚Äôs easy to switch out that configuration for testing.During testing it‚Äôs common to utilize an **embedded test database**.You certainly wouldn‚Äôt want to be running your tests with important production data, and Spring‚Äôs Data Access support helps to set up that embedded test database and ensure that your code points to that during tests.

#### 2. **Spring Integration**

In this section ,we will briefly take a look at the features that the Spring Framework provides for integration.

* Applications don‚Äôt live in isolation that needs to share data and work with other apps.
* **Integration** is all about making different systems and applications work together.
* So how does one application ‚Äútalk‚Äù to another?This is a multi-sided problem:
     - How do you expose operations to other systems?
     - How do you invoke or run operations on other systems?
* There are many Different Ways to expose operations to other systems:
     - RMI (Remote Method Invocation)
     - Messaging Systems
     - Web Services (which is the most popular): are simply operations that are exposed and accessible via the web.
     And the spring framework makes it easy to both expose and invoke web services.
  **Example of web services**: expose an operation: looking up an account by its id
  ![webServices]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/webServices.png" | relative_url }})
 
  **Example of web services**: invoke our service within another application
  Spring Framework provides support for invoking our REST service,and you utilize something called a RestTemplate which abstracts away tedious(boring) details like : 
     - Connecting to the web service
     - Sending the command
     - Handling the response from the web service
   
   ```java
   restTemplate.getForObject("http://foo.com/account/123",Account.class);
   ```
* **RestTemplate** makes calling web services as easy as one line.
* **Just call the service** and RestTemplate **takes care of the ‚Äúrest‚Äù**.

#### 3. **Spring Testing**

* Testing is an important part of developing software , 
so it‚Äôs no surprise that the Spring Framework strives to 
help in this area as well.And there‚Äôs many different levels at which software is tested, 
and the spring framework focuses on two different areas, on Unit testing and Integration 
testing .

1. **Unit testing**: 
   - Let‚Äôs start by talking about Unit testing : is 
   a software development process in which the smallest testable 
   parts of an application,called units,are individually and independently scrutinized 
   for proper operation.
   - The Spring Framework support for testing largely comes as a side effect of using 
   Dependency Injection.
   - How does **DI(Dependency Injection)** help make testing easier?
         
       * with unit testing, the idea is to test 
           the smallest unit of code possible,and when 
           the code that‚Äôs being tested has no dependencies ,
           the unit testing becomes a fairly easy process.
           In this case the developer is forced to declare what the code depends on.
           **So during testing dependent code can be replaced with code that 
           behaves certain way** and this action of replacing pieces of 
           code with controlled code is called **Mocking**.
           
       * however ,when the code under test has dependencies ,it‚Äôs important 
           to be able to control how those  dependencies behave in order to 
           restrict the testing to just the code and not the dependencies.
           For example:
           
           ![UnitTesting]({{ "/assets/img/sample/firstBlog/unitTesting.png" | relative_url }})
           
           This code has been written with DI in mind and declares that it depends on the 
           SecurityManager.During testing ,we can mock this dependency and control what 
           security clearance level is returned.
           
       * Spring Framework comes with several built-in mocks to make testing easier and faster.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.
   It occurs after unit testing.Integration Testing is focused on how various parts of a an application integrate together.
        
      * Spring Framework provides support for **piecing together parts of an application** for testing.
      * Spring Framework provides support for **common integration testing scenarios**: testing data access ,whole parts of a web application.
      * Spring Framework provides support for **cleaning up after tests**: test modify things,need to reverse modifications after test so as to not
        affect the next tests.
